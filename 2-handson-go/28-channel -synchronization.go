// We can use channels to synchronize execution across goroutines. Hereâ€™s an example of using a blocking receive to wait for a goroutine to finish. When waiting for multiple goroutines to finish, you may prefer to use a WaitGroup.

package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func worker(done chan bool) {
    fmt.Print("working...")
    time.Sleep(time.Second)
    fmt.Println("done")

    done <- true
}

func main() {

    done := make(chan bool, 1)
    go worker(done)

    <-done
}
