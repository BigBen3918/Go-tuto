// In the previous example we looked at spawning external processes. We do this when we need an external process accessible to a running Go process. Sometimes we just want to completely replace the current Go process with another (perhaps non-Go) one. To do this we’ll use Go’s implementation of the classic exec function.

package main

import (
    "os"
    "os/exec"
    "syscall"
)

func main() {

    binary, lookErr := exec.LookPath("ls")
    if lookErr != nil {
        panic(lookErr)
    }

    args := []string{"ls", "-a", "-l", "-h"}

    env := os.Environ()

    execErr := syscall.Exec(binary, args, env)
    if execErr != nil {
        panic(execErr)
    }
}
