// A common requirement in programs is getting the number of seconds, milliseconds, or nanoseconds since the Unix epoch. Hereâ€™s how to do it in Go.

package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func main() {

    now := time.Now()
    fmt.Println(now)

    fmt.Println(now.Unix())
    fmt.Println(now.UnixMilli())
    fmt.Println(now.UnixNano())

    fmt.Println(time.Unix(now.Unix(), 0))
    fmt.Println(time.Unix(0, now.UnixNano()))
}
